# Regex Tutorial- Matching an email address

Regex, or regular expressions are useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern. They are also frequently used to validate input. In this tutorial, I will explain a regex functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

In this tutorial, I will be describing the following expression: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. This regex can be used to verify that a user input is a valid email address. 

Each part of this regex has an unique responsibility to make sure that an user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the @ symbol, followed by a domain.
